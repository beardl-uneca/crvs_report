## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Instructions – please read these pages carefully and delete once the template has been finalised
For detailed instructions on how to use this template, refer to the ‘Production of a Vital Statistics Report: Guide’ (2020), available at the [resource website](https://www.vitalstrategies.org/vital-statistics-report-production).

This template was developed as a practical tool for national authorities responsible for producing vital statistics reports from civil registration systems, primarily those in developing countries with little experience in this area. These authorities vary from country to country depending on the institutional responsibilities provided by the country’s legal framework for civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS), as well as its existing administrative and organisational structures. In most countries, the responsibility to produce a vital statistics report rests with the national statistical office. In some countries, the civil registration office produces statistics pertaining to birth and death events, whereas in others, the ministry of health is responsible for the production of statistics on deaths and cause of death. Irrespective of the model adopted, it is important that all involved agencies collaborate in the production of the national vital statistics report. 
CRVS systems vary between countries. It is therefore difficult to make a template that suits all countries. Responsible authorities need to adjust the template to the context of their CRVS system and conditions in their own countries. Given that there are numerous detailed manuals and recommendations on vital statistics, this template is intended mainly for countries with limited data availability and resources. More advanced options have also been included for countries where this is feasible. 


General instructions:

	Sections that need updating with country data are currently shown in \textcolor{grey text}-{grey}. To update, simply click anywhere in the grey text and start typing—noting that this will automatically delete the example text.

	General instructions, and optional sections, tables and figures are indicated with \textcolout{*red italicised text*}-{red}. After reading the instructions and updating or deleting the optional sections, remember to delete the text boxes with the \textcolout{*red italicised text*}-{red}. To do this, click anywhere on the text; then click on the three dots that appear to the left of the text box. Once the text box is highlighted, press either ‘delete’ or ‘backspace’ on the keyboard.

	There are eight optional sections and several optional tables and figures in the Template. While countries are encouraged to complete as many of the sections as possible, some of them require additional data that may not be available. The optional sections are:
	3.2 – timeliness of registration
	3.4 – data adjustment and redistribution
	4.8 – other fertility indicators
	5.9 – life expectancy
	5.10 – foetal deaths
	5.11 – other mortality indicators
	6.4 – other cause-specific mortality indicators
	7.0 – marriages and divorces

	There is an associated Excel Workbook with pre-populated graphs that can be modified and copied into the Template, which is available at the resource website. The workbook also contains working examples on data adjustment, data redistribution, a life table and age standardisation.

	It is strongly recommended that all rates and ratios be calculated using the adjusted number of events (births or deaths), to account for incomplete registration. Note that if registration for births or deaths is lower than around 50%, the adjusted numbers are likely to be of very poor quality and should be interpreted with caution.

	If data are very incomplete, or the total number of vital events is small (due to small population sizes), aggregating data over three or five years (rather than providing single-year data) is also recommended. A good way to check if aggregation is needed is to look at graphs of vital events using single-year data over time (for example, the crude birth or death rate). If there are large variations in the data year-on-year, this is likely a result of random (or stochastic) variation, caused by small/uncertain values, and data should be aggregated to help smooth these random effects.

	Any questions or comments on the template should be directed to fmalik@vitalstrategies.org 


This template is based on the United Nations Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3 (2014)  and has used the following definitions for key variables:
	The date of occurrence is the exact date when the event occurred, and should be expressed in terms of day, month and year. Total numbers of registered live births, deaths, foetal deaths, marriages and divorces should be based on date of occurrence, which is the recommended basis for the time reference of all vital statistics tabulations.
	The date of registration of a vital event is the day, month and year when the entry in the civil registration system was made. The time of day, i.e., hour and minutes, may also be recorded if required by the registration law.
	Place of occurrence is the geographical location in the country: (a) locality and (b) major division or other geographical place in which the locality is situated, where the live birth, death, delivery of a dead foetus, marriage or divorce occurred. Counts of the numbers of vital events by place of occurrence are useful for the planning and evaluation of various medical, health and social programmes. For example, data on the number of live births or deaths by place of occurrence are useful in the planning and evaluation of medical facilities and manpower, and in monitoring the workload and performance of the civil registration system in each civil division.
	Place of registration is the geographical location in the country: (a) locality and (b) major civil division or other geographical place, where the live birth, death, delivery of a dead foetus, marriage or divorce is registered in the civil registration system. This information should be provided in enough detail to enable each specific registration office to be identified for a variety of administrative purposes, including backtracking for clarification of registration and statistical reporting problems, for local registration office workload analyses, and for optimal geographical distribution of registration points with reasonable proximity to where vital events are occurring.
	Place of usual residence is the geographical location in the country, locality or civil division, or foreign country, where the specified person usually resides. This need not be the same as either the place where he or she was found at the time of the occurrence of the event or inquiry, or his or her legal residence. For vital statistics purposes, the place of usual residence of a live birth, a foetal death or an infant death is the place where the mother usually resides. Most tables and graphs should be based on the place of usual residence.
	Urban and rural is a derived topic of high priority in a vital statistics system which is based on geographical information obtained from place of occurrence and place of usual residence. Because of national differences in the characteristics that distinguish urban from rural areas, the distinction between the urban and rural populations is not yet amenable to a single definition that would be applicable to all countries or, for the most part, even to the countries within a region. Where there are no regional recommendations on the matter, countries must establish their own definitions in accordance with their own needs. Most countries base their definition of urban and rural on administrative areas, while a few countries use population density as the basis.

Definitions
It is useful to include a list of definitions used in the report, especially for terms with varying definitions internationally, or any terms that are country-specified. Update the list below, including any country-specific definitions used and then delete this text box by clicking on the three dots to the left of the box and pressing ‘delete’ on the keyboard.
Age-specific fertility rate (ASFR): The annual number of births to women of a particular age group per 1,000 women in that age group.
Age-specific mortality rate (ASMR): A mortality rate limited to a particular age group. The numerator is the number of deaths in that age group; the denominator is the number of persons in that age group in the population.
Cause of death: ‘All those diseases, morbid conditions or injuries which either resulted in or contributed to death and the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced any such injuries’.  Symptoms and modes of dying, such as heart failure or respiratory failure, are not considered to be causes of death for statistical purposes (see ‘ill-defined cause of death’).
Completeness of registration: The proportion of vital events that are registered. It is the number of registered vital events divided by an estimate of the actual number of vital events that occurred in the same population during a specific period of time.
Crude birth rate (CBR): The number of live births relative to the size of that population during a given period, usually one year. It is expressed as the number of live births per 1,000 population per year.
Crude death rate (CDR): The number of deaths relative to the size of that population during a given period, usually one year. It is expressed as the number of deaths per 1,000 population per year.
Death: The permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after live birth has taken place (postnatal cessation of vital functions without capability of resuscitation). This definition excludes foetal deaths, which are defined separately.
Foetal death (also referred to as ‘stillbirth’): ‘Death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy; the death is indicated by the fact that after such separation the foetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles.’  Note that this definition broadly includes all terminations of pregnancy other than live births, as defined above.
Ill-defined cause of death: Any code that cannot or should not be used for the underlying cause of death (generally referring to ‘R codes’). For instance, a ‘mode of death’ such as heart failure or kidney failure, symptoms such as back pain or depression, and risk factors such as high blood pressure are all uninformative, ill-defined codes for public health purposes. 
Infant mortality rate (IMR): Probability (expressed as a rate per 1,000 live births) of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 1, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period.
Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years that a newborn could expect to live, if he or she were to pass through life exposed to the sex- and age-specific death rates prevailing at the time of his or her birth, for a specific year, in a given country, territory, or geographic area.
Live birth: ‘The complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered live born (all live-born infants should be registered and counted as such, irrespective of gestational age or whether alive or dead at the time of registration, and if they die at any time following birth, they should also be registered and counted as deaths).’ 
Maternal death: ‘The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.’ 
Maternal mortality ratio (MMR): The number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period.
Neonatal mortality rate (NMR): Probability (expressed as a rate per 1,000 live births) of a child born in a specific year or period dying in the first 30 days of life, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period.
Sex ratio at birth: The number of male births for a specific area and during a specified period divided by the number of female births for the same area and period. The sex ratio is an important demographic indicator of the distribution of boys and girls at birth.
Total fertility rate (TFR): The sum of age-specific fertility rates for females aged between 15 and 49 years during a specified period, usually one year. It is an estimate of the average number of children a cohort of women would bear if they went through their childbearing years experiencing the same age-specific fertility rates.
Under-5 mortality rate (U5MR): The probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period. The under-5 mortality rate as defined here is strictly speaking not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as rate per 1,000 live births.
Underlying cause of death: The cause of death to be used for primary statistical tabulation purposes has been designated as the underlying cause of death. The underlying cause of death is defined as ‘(a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.’

SECTION 3.2 IS OPTIONAL. If data on the timeliness of registration (or extent of delayed registration) are available, present it here. The table provided is for annual data, however if a ‘late’ registration is defined as seven or 30 (or X) days after the event, update the table to match the system.
Remember to state if the report uses only current registration data (from events occurring in that year) or includes both current and late registrations.
3.2	Timeliness of registration
A late registration is the registration of a vital event after the legally specified time period but within the grace period (usually one year following the vital event). Delayed registration is the registration of a vital event after the grace period has expired. ENTER TEXT HERE. Describe the tables below—has there been an improvement in timeliness of registration over time? What may have contributed to this? Also comment on if there are any major differences for births and deaths.

3.3	Completeness of registration
Calculating the completeness of registration can be used to monitor the performance of the CRVS system in capturing all vital events and allows for adjustment of incomplete data. Completeness is defined as the number of vital events in a population that are registered, divided by the estimated number of vital events that occurred in the same year. The value is multiplied by 100 to express completeness as a per cent:
Completeness (%)=  (Number of vital events registered)/(Estimated number of vital events)  ×100

4.5	Crude birth rate
The crude birth rate (CBR) is the number of live births per 1,000 population over a given period (usually one year). When combined with the crude death rate and net migration, crude birth rates can tell us how much the population is increasing or decreasing. They can also help with planning and resource allocation by providing important information such as how many children will be entering school in the coming years, or how many adults will be entering the workforce.  
ENTER TEXT HERE. Discuss the trend (remember to use adjusted data when calculating the CBR). If the CBR is increasing or decreasing, is this because the number of births is changing substantially (refer to the number of births in the previous section), or is it because of changes in the population size (i.e. out-migration)? Are there any major differences in the CBR by place of usual residence of the mother?

5.5	Crude death rate
As a mortality indicator, the crude death rate (CDR) is the simplest measure of population health status. It is a measure of the number of deaths relative to the size of that population during a given period, usually one year. It is expressed in numbers of deaths per 1,000 population per year. 
ENTER TEXT HERE. Discuss the trend in the CDR (remember to use the adjusted number of deaths in the numerator). If CDR is increasing or decreasing, is this because the number of deaths is changing substantially (refer to the number of deaths in the previous section), changes in completeness of registration, or changes in the age structure of the population? Are there any important differences in the CDR by place of usual residence of the decedent?

Insert the line graph from Tab F5.4 of the Excel Workbook here.
Figure 5.4 Age-specific mortality rates by sex, year
 

5.7	Infant and child mortality
The neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is the number of deaths among live-born infants during the first 28 days of life per 1,000 live births over a specified time period. Mortality during the neonatal period (the first 28 days of life) accounts for a large proportion of deaths and is a useful indicator of maternal and newborn neonatal health and care. Generally, as infant mortality decreases and fewer deaths are attributed to infectious diseases and environmental influences, a greater proportion of infant deaths would be expected to occur in the neonatal period. The neonatal mortality rate, however, should not increase as this occurs. 
As with the NMR, the infant mortality rate (IMR: deaths among children less than 1 year) and under-5 mortality rate (U5MR: deaths among children less than 5 years) are important indicators of overall population health and well-being. ENTER TEXT HERE. Comment on the table below – how has infant and child mortality changed over time? If estimates are available from other sources (such as a survey), mention them here and discuss any major differences.

THE MATERNAL MORTALITY RATIO SHOULD ONLY BE CALCULATED IF THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF DEATH REGISTRATION COMPLETENESS AND REPORTING OF CAUSE OF DEATH.
5.8	Maternal mortality
A maternal death is defined by WHO as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is the ratio of the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period (usually one year). ENTER TEXT HERE. Comment on the table below—has the MMR changed over time? If the data shows considerable variation year-on-year, try presenting data in three or five year averages (especially if there is a very small number of maternal deaths reported each year).

Life expectancy at 40 years of age is also an indicative measure of premature mortality. It is the number of additional years a person aged 40 would be expected to live, on average, if they continued to experience current mortality rates. ENTER TEXT HERE. Comment on how long a 40-year-old is expected to live, also compare with life expectancy at birth. Are there still differences between males and females? Has the gap increased or decreased, when compared with life expectancy at birth?

SECTION 5.10 IS OPTIONAL. FOETAL DEATHS SHOULD ONLY BE REPORTED ON IF THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF DEATH REGISTRATION COMPLETENESS AND GOOD SYSTEMS FOR RECORDING FOETAL DEATHS.
5.10	Foetal deaths
A foetal death is a death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, and is sometimes referred to as a ‘dead-born foetus’ or ‘stillbirth’. The registration of foetal deaths is important in measuring pregnancy outcomes, women’s health, and mortality occurring just before, during and shortly after birth. ENTER TEXT HERE. Comment on the tables below. Has the number of foetal deaths changed over time? Are there any estimates on the completeness of data on foetal deaths? Has this improved over time? If available, comment on any trends by gestational age and birth weight of the foetus. Are most foetal deaths occurring in very young foetuses?

6.1	Deaths by broad cause of death group
ENTER TEXT HERE. Provide some background information on the three groups (communicable, noncommunicable, and external causes) and describe what ill-defined codes are and why there are important. Refer to Chapter 6, page 58, of the Guide for more information and example text. Describe the graph below: Does it make sense for the country? What proportion of codes are ill-defined? Is this likely to have an impact on policy?
Insert the bar graph from Tab F6.1 of the Excel Workbook here.

6.3	Leading causes of death by age and sex
ENTER TEXT HERE. Briefly discuss all-age causes of death and note that causes by age group will be discussed in the following sections in more detail. Discuss the differences by sex if any. Also discuss whether the leading causes of death for either sex were communicable or non-communicable diseases. Note that causes of death by all ages may be misleading as the leading causes of death differ by the age of the decedent.
Discuss here the proportion of ill-defined deaths (R codes) and what they mean in terms of data quality. Discuss some of the potential reasons contributing to ill-defined causes of death.

ENTER TEXT HERE. Comment on leading causes of death for infants and children and whether this is consistent with expected patterns – a large proportion of deaths due to communicable, neonatal and nutritional diseases; very few deaths due to noncommunicable diseases (apart from those relating to congenital malformations); and a small number of deaths due to external causes and accidents.

ENTER TEXT HERE. Comment on leading causes of death for adolescents and adults. Note any major differences between males and females – we would expect to see many more males dying of causes related to injuries and accidents than females. Deaths due to noncommunicable diseases should account for a higher proportion of deaths for both sexes than in previous age groups.

6.3.4	Older adults (70+ years old)
ENTER TEXT HERE. Comment on leading causes of death for older adults. Note any major differences between males and females – we would expect to see most deaths due to noncommunicable diseases for both sexes; however it is common to see an increase in deaths due to communicable diseases and also external causes (due to trips and falls). Is there a noticeable increase in deaths coded to R codes among this age group? Is the pattern the same for males and females?
